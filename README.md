# Quote Machine
The quote machine fetches quotation text and author data through an API and renders an inspirational quote on page load and through use of a new quote button. 

## Background
This was built to gain a practical knowledge with the fetch method and consuming APIs. This project was a great opportunity to work with a UX Visual Designer and collaborate to create a fun experience for the web user.  

## Inspiration
This was built with data received from freecodecamp.org for API manipulation in their quote machine project.
